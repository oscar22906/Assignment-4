? The teeth are hungry for answers 
? sharpening their judgment

? The teeth find you lacking 
? They are getting impatient 
? The teeth crave better vocabulary 
? They are snarling at your errors 
? The teeth are unimpressed by your attempts 
? They gnash in disappointment 
? The teeth snap at your word 
? They are grinding in frustration 
? Wrong choice 
? The teeth gnaw at your failed attempt 
? The teeth are growling at your mistake 
? You freaking suck
